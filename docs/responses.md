What Are the Different Address Verification Service (AVS) Response Codes?
=========================================================================

The following is a list of possible Address Verification Service (AVS) response codes and their corresponding definitions. Each code is unique.

This response code signifies a perfect match between the street address entered by the customer and the billing address on file with the credit card issuing bank but a mismatch between ZIP codes.

**B = Address not provided for AVS check or street address match, postal code could not be verified**\
This response code signifies that the transaction was submitted to [Authorize.Net](http://Authorize.Net)® without address information so the AVS check could not be performed.

This response code signifies that an error occurred on the processing network while processing the AVS request so AVS information is not available for this transaction.
